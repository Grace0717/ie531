Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma Demo
Reading a (10000 x 1000) Matrix from file 'JL_Data1_new'
Reduced Dimension = 200
epsilon = 0.1
delta = 0.1
Reduced Dimension (i.e. 200) should be >= 922 for the bound to hold with probability 0.9
It took 0.187492 minutes to read data from file 'JL_Data1_new'
#Trails for the testing-phase = 100
It took 0.00245728 minutes for testing to be completed
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma is satisfied 93-many times over 100 attempts
